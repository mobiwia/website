Process manager part lists all the running processes and lets you manipulate them.

-   Processes are sorted by their category
-   Click an app to kill it, long click to select action from menu
-   Ignore function can only set ignoration on running application instance, if application is restarted or it comes to front the ignoration will be removed (system changes oom values during an application's lifecycle on purpose, i won't change this)
-   The higher OOM value of a process is, the more likely it will be killed next
