            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nBefore you start\n\n\nIf you have problems with the GPS receiver (no lock), \nor issues with the sensors (wrong compass orientation etc.), please read the \nFAQ\n. \nThe FAQ contains a lot of useful information about possible problems, use cases etc.\n\n\nWhat does it do?\n\n\nGPS Status \n Toolbox\n is a simple program to show all the GPS and sensor data of \nyour phone. It is designed to be simple, yet effective. It helps you to see what is \nhappening while the GPS is trying to acquire your locations and can be used as a \nsimple compass, as a leveling tool. It will measure the phone\u2019s speed and acceleration, \nthe brightness or the air pressure (if your phone has the necessary sensors.) The \nprogram also supports basic navigation functions that are useful when you are out \nin the wild. The app has four main screens plus it can display a system notification \nto show GPS data.\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n - display for all your raw data\n\n\nRadar\n - for basic off-road navigation\n\n\nLocations\n - for your stored locations\n\n\nSensors\n - for listing and testing all the sensors available in your device\n\n\nSettings\n - for customizing units, display properties\n\n\n\n\nStatus screen\n\n\n \n\n\nThe screen has three main parts: The \nsky grid (G)\n, the \nsignal strength \nbar (V)\n and the \ninstrument panels\n.\n\n\nThe sky grid \n(G)\n shows the GPS satellites above you as the receiver in the \nphone detects them. GPS satellites (with IDs 1-32) are represented by disks. \nGLONASS satellites (with IDs r1-r25) are shown as rectangles, BEIDOU satellites \n(with IDs c1-c33) are shown as crosses (x) while GALILEO sats (with IDs e1-e35) \nare displayed as plus (+) signs. The size of the symbol depends on the signal \nstrength received from that satellite. The color shows what data is available \nfor that satellite and how it is currently used by the phone.\n\n\n\n\ngreen\n: satellite is used while determining the location\n\n\nyellow\n: all orbital data is available, but the satellite is not used\n\n\nblue\n: only rough orbital data (almanach) is available\n\n\ngrey\n: orbital data is not available\n\n\n\n\nUsually at least 4 satellites are required to have a lock. The more satellites are available \nthe more accurate the position will be (to a certain limit. i.e. having 20 sats in a lock does \nnot really increase the accuracy compared to 10). Certain phones may opt to use only a single \nconstellation at a time and fall back to others if that constellation does not have enough \nvisible satellites.) The order of preference is market dependent, however it is mostly GPS, \nthen GLONASS and then BEIODU. As of the beginning of 2017 only a few phones support \nthe GALILEO constellation. If you have problems getting a fix, please \nread the FAQ\n \nfor troubleshoothing tips.\n\n\nThe compass needle \n(C)\n in the center of the grid will show you the direction of the \nmagnetic field as measured by your phone. (This may or may not be the actual magnetic north, \ndepending on how much extra magnetic field is present in your environment. Magnetic anomalies \nare always present in buildings and vehicles so you should \nNOT\n expect your compass to \nwork flawlessly in these environments.) The program automatically calculates the magnetic \ndeclination (the difference between magnetic and true north) and the absolute strength of \nthe magnetic field at your current location \n(M)\n. If the measured field is stronger \nthan the calculated you will see the needle grow while with weaker fields the needle will \nshrink. If there are no extra magnetic fields in your environment the needle should be roughly \nthe same size as the inner circle of the sky grid. In addition to this, the magnetic compass \nin your phone reports the accuracy of the measurement. \n\n\nIf the needle gets transparent (or you see a question mark appearing in the magnetic\nfield reading instrument) then the compass may need a recalibration (in the side navigation \n\nCompass Calibration\n menu). The recalibration \ncan be done any time the app is running (i.e. you don't need to enter the 'Calibration' dialog, \nhowever that dialog displays the accuracy reported by the phone so you will get a bit better \nfeedback.) You can recalibrate by either rotation your phone several times along its 3 axes \n(as instructed in the dialog), or by less scientifically, just simply holding your phone and \nwaving it in an 8 pattern. You should test which method works best as it is also dependent on \nthe actual firmware of the phone.\n\n\nMagnetic compasses are inherently inaccurate. GPS can do a much better job determining your \ndirection of movement. By default the sky grid aligns itself using the magnetic compass. \nOnce you move faster than 5km/h a green arrow will appear showing your direction of movement \nand the sky grid will align using the much more accurate GPS heading data. The red/blue arrows \n\n(W)\n around the perimeter of the grid show the true north/south while the red/blue dots \n\n(X)\n show the magnetic north/south. The difference between the two direction is known as \nthe magnetic declination \n(M)\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThere is a small empty circle \n(Y)\n (can be turned off in Settings) that allows you to find the direction of any satellite. Just turn and tilt your phone until the circle covers a satellite symbol. Your phone will point towards the real satellite that is some 20000 km away from you. (This feature is not particularly useful, but it is extremely geeky!)\n\n\n\n\nThe grid also contains a moving amber circle (can be turned off in Settings). This can \nbe used as a leveling tool \n(L)\n to find horizontal or vertical surfaces using your phone. \nYou may need to calibrate the leveling tool before using it (in the side navigation menu).\n\n\nIn the \nPRO\n version, the rotation speed \n(R)\n of the phone is also displayed along the \nperimeter of the sky grid. The longer the green arcs, the faster the phone is rotating.\n\n\nThe signal strength bars \n(V)\n show the individual satellite signal strength values. \nThe bar is divided into 4 parts displaying GPS, GLONASS, BEIDOU and GALILEO sats (left to right).\n\n\nThe rest of the screen displays numerical values derived from the phone\u2019s sensors and GPS.\n\n\n\n\nHeading \n(H)\n: the absolute direction the phone is facing\n\n\nOrientation \n(O)\n: main cardinal points your phone is heading currently\n\n\naGPS data age \n(E)\n: the age of the GPS assistance data used for speeding up the GPS locks.\n\n\nError \n(E)\n: the accuracy of the actual location information.\n\n\nNumber of satellites \n(F)\n: the number of satellites used for the actual fix and the total number of satellites visible for the GPS receiver (GPS+GLONASS/total.)\n\n\nPitch and Roll \n(L)\n: the attitude of your phone.\n\n\nMagnetic field \n(M)\n: the three values represent the strength of measured magnetic field / the calculated strength of the field / magnetic declination (the difference between true and magnetic north). (Tip: the first slash will turn into a question mark if the phone detects that you have to recalibrate the phone\u2019s magnetometer.)\n\n\nAcceleration \n(Z)\n: the measured linear acceleration of the phone.\n\n\nSpeed \n(S)\n: the actual speed measured by the GPS.\n\n\nAltitude \n(A)\n: the current altitude relative to the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or the WGS84 geoid (configured in Settings).\n\n\nLast fix \n(I)\n: the GPS time of the last valide fix that is shown currently on the screen.\n\n\nLocation (latitude/longitude) \n(J)\n: The acquired GPS location (format is configured in Settings).\n\n\nBattery info \n(B)\n: the remaining charge, battery voltage and temperature.\n\n\nDOP (dilution of precision) \n(D)\n: a value that represents how optimal the satellite constellation is. Smaller values represent better satellite arrangement. The total, horizontal and vertical component is also displayed.\n\n\nBrightness \n(K)\n: the measured light flux (if the phone supports it). The accuracy of this value is dependent on the quality of the brightness sensor.\n\n\nPressure \n(P)\n [\nPRO\n]: atmospheric pressure measured by the phone sensor (if the phone supports it).\n\n\nRotation speed \n(R)\n [\nPRO\n]: this is the direct readout from the phone\u2019s gyroscope sensor (if the phone supports it).\n\n\nAmbient temperature \n(T)\n [\nPRO\n]: the temperature around the phone (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3).\n\n\nDewpoint \n(N)\n [\nPRO\n]: the temperature below which water vapor will start condense (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3).\n\n\nHumidity \n(Q)\n [\nPRO\n]: the amount of water vapor in the air (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3).\n\n\nHumidex \n(U)\n [\nPRO\n]: an index that shows how hot the weather feels to the average person (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3).\n\n\n\n\nStatus Notification\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the application will show the most important GPS data whenever the \nGPS is accesses, even if other apps accessing it.\n\n\nIf you do not need the notification feature, you can turn it off in \n\nSettings / Background Behavior / GPS Status in Notification -\n Never\n.\n\n\n\n\n(A)\n Number of satellites: GPS in use [+ GLONASS in use] / Total visible\n\n\n(B)\n Average signal to noise ratio (0-40dB)\n\n\n(D)\n Dilution of Precision (smaller is better)\n\n\n(S)\n Speed\n\n\n(L)\n Current location\n\n\n(A)\n Altitude\n\n\n(E)\n Position accuracy\n\n\n\n\nTapping on the notification item will open GPS Status. This is an easy way to open the app from any other application that is using the GPS. Wait for the lock in GPS Status then press the back button to immediately return to the original application without loosing the lock. The notification have some extra actions that allows you to dismiss it temporarily, re-download the aGPS data, or mark your current position for future use.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature uses little to no battery as the notification is updated only when it is shown. The display routine does NOT access or keep the GPS open. It just intercepts the location data that is requested by the other application. GPS Status never keeps the GPS open if it was put into the background.\n\n\n\n\nRadar screen\n\n\n\n\nRadar screen can store a single way point (Edit/Mark action button) and allows you to navigate back using the GPS and the internal compass in your phone. Just move towards the point and use the screen as it would be a \"radar\". The radar screen will display heading and distance to the target point. It is possible to enter or edit the target coordinates and you can also share your current location by using the Share action. The marked point can be displayed in any of the supported mapping applications. Additional waypoints can be displayed on the radar if you change the given waypoint's visibility on the Locations screen (tap the eye icon).\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nLong tapping the Edit/Mark mark location button will immediately store the current location as a target (and will override the previous target without displaying a dialog). This is useful to drop a breadcrumb so you will be able to get back here later (i.e. after parking a car etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading \n(H)\n: the absolute direction the phone is facing.\n\n\nOrientation \n(O)\n: main cardinal points your phone is heading currently.\n\n\nCompass needle \n(C)\n: magnetic compass needle.\n\n\nError \n(E)\n: the accuracy of the actual location information.\n\n\nDistance \n(D)\n : distance to the current target point.\n\n\nAccuracy range \n(F)\n : the current position accuracy shown as a range around the actual position.\n\n\nTarget (latitude/longitude) \n(L)\n: the coordinates of the currently selected target point.\n\n\nSpeed \n(S)\n: the actual speed.\n\n\nAltitude \n(A)\n: the current altitude relative to the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or the WGS84 geoid (configured in Settings).\n\n\nBearing \n(B)\n : Bearing to the target point\n\n\nLocation (latitude/longitude) \n(J)\n: the current location.\n\n\nTarget point \n(T)\n : the target point shown on the radar grid relative to the current position.\n\n\nAdditional waypoints \n(W)\n [\nPRO\n]: additional waypoints selected on the \nLocations\n screen.\n\n\n\n\nLocations\n\n\n \n\n\nThis screen allows you to store 3 waypoints persistently (unlimited in PRO version). \nLong tapping an item puts the list into edit mode where you can select more items or \nreorder them. After selecting items you can export them by choosing the \"Export\" \nitem the action bar. Importing in KML, CSV and GPX format is also available here.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWaypoints can be added either from the Radar screen by opening the Edit target \ndialog and choosing \"Save as POI\" or by tapping the 'Add location' button on the \n'Locations' screen. You can assign a color to the point. You can edit an item by \ntapping on it. The Edit dialog allows you to select the given point as a target \non the Radar screen.\n\n\nSensor Diagnostics\n\n\n\n\nThis screen can be used for troubleshooting phone sensor issues. It displays \nall possible sensors and marks the ones that are actually supported by your \ndevice. It also tries to acquire some values from the sensors to see \nwhether they are working correctly. If you see error marks on the list, \ntap the entry and follow the instruction to test the given sensors properly.\n\n\nSettings\n\n\n\n\nDisplay units, UI language, sensor filtering, color scheme, message used for sharing \nyour location and a bunch of other options can be configured to customize the \napplication. Note that GPS Status is using the WGS84 datum whenever coordinates are used.\n\n\nSpanish PDF version",

(yes I'm serious)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have previously purchased the PRO version, but now I have to reinstall it. How do I re-activate my license?\n\n\nPurchases on Google Play are bound to your google account. It means that you can activate the license on ALL of your devices as long as they are registered with your google account. You should never ever pay twice for the same thing! Prior to 2016 GPS Status used separate 'key' application for licensing. Starting from the beginning of 2016 in-app payments are used for licensing. First you need to know which type of license you have. The best is to take a look at your purchase history and find GPS Status on \nwallet.google.com\n. If you have purchased the PRO key application, you can \nre-download it again from the Play Store\n. If you purchased the license as an in-app payment (you will see \"PRO Features\" in your transaction list), just install and open the main (free)\u00a0app and tap the 'Get PRO' item in the side navigation menu. Play Store will detect and inform you that you already own\u00a0this item and GPS Status will activate the license immediately. If you have issues or you have changed your google account for whatever reason, please contact the support address with your original transaction id.\u00a0\n\n\nI do not like/need the notification when an app accesses the GPS. Can I turn it off?\n\n\nYes. GPS Status never runs in the background unless an other app access the GPS. You can turn off the notification feature in 'Settings / Background behavior / Show Notification = Never' and then restarting the app (quitting with the back button and then starting it again).\n\n\nThe notification sometimes is not sown when Goolge Maps is running.\n\n\nThis is happening on Android 6 and later. Goolge Maps is no longer using the GPS in the phone directly. Instead it's using Google's proprietary \"fused location provider\". Because of this, GPS is started only occasionally in the background and 3\nrd\n party applications are not notified about it. Sadly this cannot be worked around as indeed in these cases GPS is NOT used so there is no point to show the status.\n\n\nWhy do you need permission XXX?\n\n\n\n\ncoarse and fine location: we need this to display your location :)\n\n\nfull internet access: used by the advertisement and analytics component.\u00a0\n\n\naccess extra location provider commands: allows the program to re-download AGPS data or reset the GPS.\n\n\nview network state: allows checking if there is an active internet connection. If there is no net connection, advertisement and AGPS download is disabled to save memory and battery.\n\n\nStorage and Media Access:This is need only to be able to Export/Import your stored waypoints to the exteral storage.\n\n\n\n\nIt is eating all my battery according to the battery status screen. It is even running in the background.\n\n\nFortunately no. The bug is in the battery measurement routines in Android. The operating system sometimes misses the notification when the application releases the phone sensors (i.e. this issue affects all apps that heavily use the sensor system). Because of the missed \"release message\" the battery measurement routines continue to count the battery use against the application even if that application was stopped long ago and not even present in the process list. You can simply ignore this. Unfortunately you need to restart the phone to \"fix\" this malcalculation. Once you've rebooted the phone you will see the correct values again and the \"phantom\" usage will disappear. The reason why this is increasing over time without even running is that the power usage is calculated for the sensor by (current time - sensor attach time)*sensorPowerRequirements. As time passes, this value increases.\n\n\nThe GPS time is 15 seconds ahead of the official UTC time. Why? I thought GPS clocks must be extremely accurate.\n\n\nThe rotation period of the Earth is not constant and in average it is 2ms longer than 86400 sec. This causes some drift over time between the atomic clocks (used by the GPS system) and the UTC time. To avoid confusion, every now and then leap seconds are inserted into the UTC time. (Yes, there are sometimes 61s long minutes!). GPS and UTC was in sync in 1980. Since then 15 leap seconds were inserted into the UTC time. The GPS satellites brodcast this information, but only in every 12minutes. Your receiver may not heard the broadcast, so it does not know how much it should substract from the GPS time. Without this information it just displays the GPS time and does not correct it to get UTC. You should wait at least 15 minutes with the GPS turned on to receive the correction data.\n\n\nSome parts of the application are not translated or there are translation errors.\n\n\nFeel free to join the GPS Status translation project at \ncrowdin.net\n. You can add new translations, or correct existing ones.\n\n\nThe location/altitude or other data is inaccurate.\n\n\nGPS Status simply displays the data received directly from the phone hardware. In fact this is the main pupose of the software (that's why it's called status). Inaccurate data is not the fault of the software, but shows that you may not have optimal reception of GPS satellites or there is a magnetic anomaly nearby affecting your compass. Find a different location and try again. If you feel that the data is inaccurate, it may indicate a hardware issue. Please note that the sensors in your phone (including the GPS receiver) are very prone to environmental disturbances.\n\n\nMy compass is very \"jumpy\"...\n\n\nTry to set the sensor filtering in preferences. It can filter out the measurement noise, but at the same time the compass will react slower to changes.\n\n\nIs it showing magnetic or true north? How to set the magnetic declination?\n\n\nMagnetic declination is the difference between the true and magnetic north at your location. The value is calculated automatically by the program using the current geo-magnetic earth model. The algorithm uses your current location and time. To answer the question: The needle in the middle is always showing the magnetic north while the grid itself (small red arrow) points always towards true north. The angle between these two corresponds to the magnetic declination. The last number in the \"Magnetic field\" instrument is the magnetic declination in degrees.\n\n\nMy compass points to the wrong direction or I'm asked to calibrate my compass. What should I do?\n\n\nYour phone contains a digital compass which measures the magnetic field's strength in three direction with three separate sensors. The orientation of your phone is calculated from these values. Unfortunately the sensitivity of the sensors can be\u00a0a little different. To correctly calculate your orientation your phone must measure first these differences. This is done during the calibration process. To calibrate your phone, simply find a space where no external magnetic field is present (preferable outside of buildings) and rotate your phone 1-2 times on EACH of its three axes. (Swinging your phone in big 8s in all direction will also do, but it's less scientifically correct :) ). If you feel that your compass has become inaccurate you can repeat this procedure. NOTE: You should expect the compass to be very unreliable inside buildings or vehicles often pointing in opposite directions.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat does the Magnetic field reading mean?\n\n\nAside from your orientation, your phone can measure the absolute strength of the magnetic field which is displayed as the first number in the reading. The second number is calculated from your GPS position and current time using the earth geo-magnetic model. It is the theoretical strengh you should measure in an open space. If the two values are sufficiently different, then you are standing in a magnetic anomaly. This is pretty funny because this allows you to detect big nearby metal objects. Go and try hunting for treasures.\n\n\nThe compass needle changes its size... What the hell?\n\n\nThe size of the needle indicates the relative magnitude of measured magnetic field to the calculated value. If the measured and calculated value is the same, the needle should be the same size as the inner circle on the grid. If the magnetic field is bigger/smaller than it should be, the needle will be also bigger/smaller. This way you can see at a glance whether you are standing in a magnetic anomaly. If the needle is too small or too big chances are that an external magnetic field is present and the compass points to the wrong direction.",

Instead of killing every process after its Activity ended, processes are kept until the system needs more memory. These processes usually should not harm the overall performance and should give speed improvements if you start an Activity again. That's the idea.\nBut when does Android kill a process? And which process? As far as I understood android keeps a LRU (last recently used) list and starts killing the oldest unneeded process. This way it is much smarter than any of the taskkillers we see in the Market.\nJust for curiosity I started to investigate how this mechanism works. Please correct me if you think that I got something wrong:\n\nWhat I found out:\n ActivityManagerService.java tracks the \"importance\" of processes (is foreground, is running a service, ..) and reflects this importance by setting the \"oom_adj\" value of the process.\n\n(For info: \"oom_adj\" is a value of every process under Linux which gives the kernel a hint, which process it can kill in an oom [out of memory] situation. You can see this value on every Linux 2.6 system in the proc directory: /proc/[PID]/oom_adj ). The higher this value is set, the more likely this process gets selected by the kernel's oom killer.)\n\nIt seems that on Android the current forefround application gets an oom_adj value of 0 and as soon it's not visible anymore it gets some higher value. I assume the concrete value is dependent by the processes' place in the LRU list.\nThe out-of-memory killer in the standard Linux kernel only runs in one situation: when the available memory is critical low. However in the Android Linux kernel there is implemented a more fine-grained handling of low memory situations.\nI found the kernel source file \"\nlowmemorykiller.c\n\" (located in the kernel source tree under \"drivers/misc/\"; or look here for GIT source tree: tinyurl.com/lowmemkiller).\nThis module seems to be more configurable than the kernel's standard out-of-memory killer as you can define more than one memory limit, when it should get active and you can tell it which oom_adj values it may kill.\nIn other words: You can say \"\nif free memory goes below XXXX then kill some process with oom_adj greater then YYY; if free memory goes even more below than ZZZ then start to kill some processes with oom_adj greater than XYXY. and so on..\n\"\nSo it's possible to define multiple memory criterias and matching processes which can be killed in these situations. Android seems to group running processes into 6 different categories (comments taken out of \"ActivityManagerServer.java\"):\n    FOREGROUND_APP:\n        // This is the process running the current foreground app.  We'd really\n        // rather not kill it! Value set in system/rootdir/init.rc on startup.\n\n\nVISIBLE_APP:\n    // This is a process only hosting activities that are visible to the\n    // user, so we\nd prefer they don\nt disappear. Value set in\n    // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup.\n\nSECONDARY_SERVER:\n    // This is a process holding a secondary server -- killing it will not\n    // have much of an impact as far as the user is concerned. Value set in\n    // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup.\n\nHIDDEN_APP:\n    // This is a process only hosting activities that are not visible,\n    // so it can be killed without any disruption. Value set in\n    // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup.\n\nCONTENT_PROVIDER:\n    // This is a process with a content provider that does not have any clients\n    // attached to it.  If it did have any clients, its adjustment would be the\n    // one for the highest-priority of those processes.\n\nEMPTY_APP:\n    // This is a process without anything currently running in it.  Definitely\n    // the first to go! Value set in system/rootdir/init.rc on startup.\n    // This value is initalized in the constructor, careful when refering to\n    // this static variable externally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 6 categories are reflected by 6 memory limits which are configured for the lowmemorykiller in the kernel.\n\nFortunately, it is possible to configure the lowmemorykiller at runtime! :)\n (But only if you are root). The configuration is set in the file: \"/sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree\"\nSo if you want to see the current settings, you can do:\n\n# cat /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree\n This should produce output like this (or similiar): \n1536,2048,4096,5120,5632,6144\n\nThese values are the 6 memory limits on which Anedroid starts to kill processes of one of the 6 categories above. Be careful, the \nunits of these values are pages\n!! 1 page = 4 kilobyte.\nSo the example above says that Anddroid starts killing EMPTY_APP processes if available memory goes below 24MB (=6144*4/1024). And it starts to kill unused CONTENT_PROVIDERs if available memory goes below 22MB (=5632*4/1024).\nSo if you want to try if your Hero goes faster when fewer processes are running you can try to adjust these settings. For example if you practically do not want any empty processes you can set the corresponding value very high. For example, you can set the values like this:\n\n# echo \n1536,2048,4096,5120,15360,23040\n \n /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree\n\nThis example will tell Android to kill unused Content providers if less then 60MB is available and kill empty processes if available memory goes below 90MB.\nAll other processes will stay untouched! Do you see the advantage compared to process killers?\nOne word about durabilty: If you change the settings like this, they are \nNOT PERMANENT\n. They will be gone after the next restart of your phone. So you can try to play around a little bit.\n\nsource: XDA",

            "text": "F.A.Q.\n\n\nIs AutoKiller a task killer?\n\n\nThe main functionality is a minfree manager (see theory section) which tweaks system's built in routines. It also features a built in task manager and process killer.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nPlease check \ntheory/technical details\n part of this site, \nthis\n is also a good reading.\n\n\nWhy is it good to me?\n\n\nTasks are handled by the os, apps you no longer use will be cleared up in the background, no user interaction needed.\n\n\nHow shall I use it?\n\n\nCheck out the great article on \nGeek For Me\n.\n\n\nI heard android handles free memory well, why should I keep free memory?\n\n\nActually android does a \ngreat job\n with memory handling, and free ram is filled with cache immediately. So you have nothing such as \"free\" ram.\n\n\nApplication says root access needed. What is it and how can i get it?\n\n\nRoot access means you have superuser (su) permissions on your phone (only su can modify some parts of the system). To achieve it you have to make some modifications on your phones software which may hurt your guarantee, on the other side it will make it available to install custom ROMs, do full system backups, tether your internet, install applications to sd, run AutoKiller (and many other su related apps), and much more (check \nthis\n, \nthis\n and \nthis\n). The internet is full with descriptions how to root your phone, you shall just google for it, or start \nhere\n. You can also check \nthis\n wiki for more info.\n\n\nI set a minfree preset but my free memory doesn't alway get above the settings/I still have empty apps, etc...\n\n\nUnused ram is wasting of resources, so android (and the linux kernel it is built on) handles stuff wisely. AutoKiller is not killing applications meaninglessly to reach the tresholds but leaves the cleanup to the system which does it properly. My best advice is to stop checking free ram, just enjoy the smooth and lag free behavior even when your device was not rebooted for weeks.\n\n\nI heard that killing applications is unnecessary on an android device, so why should I use AutoKiller?\n\n\nUnfortunately there are many applications which cannot sleep properly, or don't release resources. (the most annoying I met with was a task killer!!!) if you have the time to find out which are these one bye one, you can kill them any time you finish using them. But if you don't want to mess with this, setting lowmemory killer is the best approach as a fix.\n\"free\" memory is not useless: memory is always filled up with cache of your most used applications. So you get resource-consuming applications killed, and got cache with preloaded data your phone will probably use.\n\n\nWhich is the best setting?\n\n\nIt depends on how you use your phone, you shall discover the best for your device, start with presets and fine-tune manually.\n\n\nI clicked on Keep alive/Lower oom, but this setting is not kept. Is the app working wrong?\n\n\nActually what this function does is that it sets the process' oom value to the lowest possible value (-17) so it will be the last in the list of killable processes. This doesn't mean it won't be killed, but the possibility is lowered. An other fact is that oom is set by the system, usually when an activity comes to front, and sometimes also in other cases, so there is no possibility to keep this setting over sessions. Conventional keep alive function therefore will never be implemented.\n\n\nI set up AutoKiller and it killed my Clock/Twitter/etc...\n\n\nIf you set really high values, it can happen that empty apps like stock android clock in background get killed. My advise in this situation is to lower the limits/choose a lower preset (-you can create direct shortcuts on your desktop to set a preset). You can also make sure that clock is running during the night if that is the last app opened before the phone is sent into sleep mode.\n\n\nI have donated and would like to set up alternate preset option properly...\n\n\nMy suggestion is to set AutoKiller to one preset lower than you would withouth this feature, so it can play nice while you use it, and set the alternate preset option to something higher, to make it clean apps in bg in case it is needed while your phone's screen is turned off. In case of my N1 I set AutoKiller to 'Aggressive' and alternate preset to 'Ultimate'. For devices with less available ram you shall choose lower values accordingly.\n\n\nWhat is Chuck Norris mode? When shall I use it?\n\n\nChuck Norris mode uses system's built in kill command to terminate the selected application. This is an aggressive way to close running applications, and lets you kill **any** running app. Including dialer and system which can lead to a quick system restart. Use this only if you know what you are doing.",

            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nA dear user of Autorun Manager VivEk wrote a user guide based on a user's perspective. He approved me to publish it here:\n\n\nAutorun Manager\n\n\nThis is an app for android OS developed by Mobiwia AndRS studio. As the name indicates this app is used to prevent apps from spawning automatically that keeps on running at background eating up resources resulting in overall reduced performance of android device. This app doesn\u2019t boost the speed of your device but actually assures that the user gets what device is really capable of. As many of us are familiar to Microsoft Windows operating system, whenever we install a new application in windows we tend to use windows start-up manager or any other third party app to disable unnecessary start-ups which increases booting speed of windows. Similarly we can improve the performance of our android device. The Android OS works in a very different way than windows, so before we directly start disabling start-ups on android we need to know how Android OS works so that we can take the full benefit of Autorun Manager app else we will just end up in frustration and writing horrible review for developer. I am writing Android OS guide from the perspective of using Autorun Manager app so that you can understand each and every function of this app.\n\n\nSo what exactly we need to improve?\n\n\nThere are three main things which we need to consider in order to speed-up the overall performance, CPU usage, Memory usage and R/W speeds. For R/W speeds I recommend you to buy good performance SD cards because tweaking this in android would be digging too deep. Memory usage is smartly managed by Android OS itself and you can tweak that with AutoKiller Memory Optimizer. I do not recommend killing any task intentionally at all. This results in misbehaviour of OS or app adding a plus to frustration. Remaining this is CPU usage which we really need to consider. I would be discussing all about to improve overall CPU performance.\n\n\nWhy this app is running?\n\n\nIn Android, apps get started automatically by using the broadcast receivers. A broadcast receiver has number of intents/actions. Whenever these actions are performed by OS/app the receiver gets triggered. The receiver then starts the app in the background and performs necessary actions in the background as decided by developer. Typical example can be, let\u2019s say intent/action is boot completed under receiver boot. Whenever android OS finishes the boot process it broadcast the message that it has finished booting. The receivers who are able to listen to this action gets triggered and starts the app. So disabling this receiver would simply disable the app from listening to this broadcast message. Remember, whether this receiver can be disabled safely is judged on basis of action/intents present in it instead of reading receiver names.\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nThere are basically two types of packages which can be classified further. The apps which are located at /system/app/ are known as system apps also known as pre-installed apps. Apps which are located at /data partition are known as user apps also known as downloaded apps. System apps are installed in internal memory which is fastest and some of this memory is shared with /data partition so that users can install their favourite apps. Newer phones come with huge internal storage, fact behind this is embedded SD card also known as internal SD card. SD cards have slower I/O speeds than internal system storage. Additional plugged in SD card would be called as external SD card. Apps located on SD card are less affected by broadcast receivers. However apps are still affected broadcast receivers which are on internal SD card, which is because internal SD card mounted before booting. Apps located on external SD cards are less affected by broadcast receivers because they are mounted after Android OS finishes booting. So a useful tip would be installing apps on external SD card. Such apps can be games, utility apps but not useful apps like mail or chat clients. However I still recommend you to disable unwanted receivers for these apps as well. Disabling broadcast receivers for system apps is recommended at all and can cause significant unexpected issues. But if you\u2019re an advanced user I encourage you to play with these apps as well. Such system apps can be preloaded promotional apps, games or any other less useful app.\n\n\nFirst Launch of app\n\n\nThis app can be run in two modes Advanced mode and Basic mode. Basic mode is not recommended and is for total beginners and for those who doesn\u2019t want to read this guide. Reason is, in basic mode the automatically starting app is killed as soon as it gets started. This scenario will make circumstances even worse who are running low performance devices. What technically happens, an apps starts automatically and Autoruns Manager app kills it. Lots of CPU cycles are wasted in this process. Some developers include functionality of re-spawning i.e. the app is started automatically after few seconds when it gets killed and pre-mentioned procedure keeps on going. Recommended is using advanced mode. \n Above image explains each and everything detailed. Now you got idea of what thing is what, let\u2019s get into what\u2019s happening. As you can see there\u2019s a package named Autorun Manager which is the app itself I\u2019m using for explaining things. This release of package has three broadcast receivers. Each of these receivers has single intent/action present in it. Before we start disabling receivers, first try to understand the reason why this receiver is included with these actions and what functionality would be removed if I disable that receiver. First receiver is named as \u201ccom.rs.autorun.AutorunStartupIntentReceiver\u201d. Remember receiver names are customized by developers so no decision can be made by just reading receiver name. It just helps in getting idea what kind of actions could be present in that receiver. This receiver has one action named \u201candroid.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\u201d. The lower case letters are representing package name which is Android OS itself in this case while the upper case letters are representing action name. It is now clear in this case that when Android OS is finishing boot process it is broadcasting message that it has finished booting. The broadcast receiver listens this broadcasting and starts the app. Now before we disable try to guess which functionality might be disabled if I disable this broadcast receiver. Possible reasons can be, the basic mode won\u2019t work because it requires the app itself to be in running condition to kill apps. Second receiver has intent named \u201ccom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\u201d. In this case package name is Google Play Store. When you install any package from Google Play Store it broadcasts the message and this receiver listens to it. Possible reasons could be collecting statistical data. Third receiver has intent named \u201ccom.rs.autorun.PeriodicAlarm\u201d. In this case package name is Autorun Manager the app itself I\u2019m using. The app itself broadcasts message and receivers listens to it and perform necessary actions. Figuring out such receivers is very hard because we\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s on developer\u2019s mind. Usually these receivers are vital parts of app. There is no need to disable such receivers because if the broadcasting app is not running then there is no triggering at all.\n\n\n--thank you VivEk",

            "text": "In Android, apps get started automatically by using the broadcast receivers. A broadcast receiver has number of intents/actions. Whenever these actions are performed by OS/app the receiver gets triggered. The receiver then starts the app in the background and performs necessary actions in the background as decided by developer. Typical example can be, let\u2019s say intent/action is boot completed under receiver boot. Whenever android OS finishes the boot process it broadcast the message that it has finished booting. The receivers who are able to listen to this action gets triggered and starts the app. So disabling this receiver would simply disable the app from listening to this broadcast message. Remember, whether this receiver can be disabled safely is judged on basis of action/intents present in it instead of reading receiver names.",

            "text": "There are basically two types of packages which can be classified further. The apps which are located at /system/app/ are known as system apps also known as pre-installed apps. Apps which are located at /data partition are known as user apps also known as downloaded apps. System apps are installed in internal memory which is fastest and some of this memory is shared with /data partition so that users can install their favourite apps. Newer phones come with huge internal storage, fact behind this is embedded SD card also known as internal SD card. SD cards have slower I/O speeds than internal system storage. Additional plugged in SD card would be called as external SD card. Apps located on SD card are less affected by broadcast receivers. However apps are still affected broadcast receivers which are on internal SD card, which is because internal SD card mounted before booting. Apps located on external SD cards are less affected by broadcast receivers because they are mounted after Android OS finishes booting. So a useful tip would be installing apps on external SD card. Such apps can be games, utility apps but not useful apps like mail or chat clients. However I still recommend you to disable unwanted receivers for these apps as well. Disabling broadcast receivers for system apps is recommended at all and can cause significant unexpected issues. But if you\u2019re an advanced user I encourage you to play with these apps as well. Such system apps can be preloaded promotional apps, games or any other less useful app.",

            "text": "This app can be run in two modes Advanced mode and Basic mode. Basic mode is not recommended and is for total beginners and for those who doesn\u2019t want to read this guide. Reason is, in basic mode the automatically starting app is killed as soon as it gets started. This scenario will make circumstances even worse who are running low performance devices. What technically happens, an apps starts automatically and Autoruns Manager app kills it. Lots of CPU cycles are wasted in this process. Some developers include functionality of re-spawning i.e. the app is started automatically after few seconds when it gets killed and pre-mentioned procedure keeps on going. Recommended is using advanced mode.   Above image explains each and everything detailed. Now you got idea of what thing is what, let\u2019s get into what\u2019s happening. As you can see there\u2019s a package named Autorun Manager which is the app itself I\u2019m using for explaining things. This release of package has three broadcast receivers. Each of these receivers has single intent/action present in it. Before we start disabling receivers, first try to understand the reason why this receiver is included with these actions and what functionality would be removed if I disable that receiver. First receiver is named as \u201ccom.rs.autorun.AutorunStartupIntentReceiver\u201d. Remember receiver names are customized by developers so no decision can be made by just reading receiver name. It just helps in getting idea what kind of actions could be present in that receiver. This receiver has one action named \u201candroid.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\u201d. The lower case letters are representing package name which is Android OS itself in this case while the upper case letters are representing action name. It is now clear in this case that when Android OS is finishing boot process it is broadcasting message that it has finished booting. The broadcast receiver listens this broadcasting and starts the app. Now before we disable try to guess which functionality might be disabled if I disable this broadcast receiver. Possible reasons can be, the basic mode won\u2019t work because it requires the app itself to be in running condition to kill apps. Second receiver has intent named \u201ccom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\u201d. In this case package name is Google Play Store. When you install any package from Google Play Store it broadcasts the message and this receiver listens to it. Possible reasons could be collecting statistical data. Third receiver has intent named \u201ccom.rs.autorun.PeriodicAlarm\u201d. In this case package name is Autorun Manager the app itself I\u2019m using. The app itself broadcasts message and receivers listens to it and perform necessary actions. Figuring out such receivers is very hard because we\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s on developer\u2019s mind. Usually these receivers are vital parts of app. There is no need to disable such receivers because if the broadcasting app is not running then there is no triggering at all.  --thank you VivEk",

            "text": "F.A.Q.\n\n\nIs this app for me?\n\n\nAns. This app is for those users who want the maximum performance their device can offer. Also for those users who are struggling with the mess of running apps. If you\u2019ve just purchased android device for just calling and messaging then obviously this app is not for you. In these days quad core devices are available at very affordable prices. Even if you\u2019re doing some multi-tasking performance issues are less visible in such devices but when you\u2019ve installed hundreds of apps and using phone frequently for gaming or multi-tasking you certainly need this app.\n\n\nIs this app free?\n\n\nAns. This app isn\u2019t free, however trial version is available at play store so you can try before you spend your hard earned money. I must mention that this app is very affordable comparing to the other apps or games for which you might have paid in past.\n\n\nI would hire a task killer rather than purchasing this app, reading huge guide and hard thinking what intent is doing what.\n\n\nAns. As I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t recommend task killers at all. It results in unexpected results from app and even developers refuse to support if you\u2019re using task killers. Let me ask you, why you\u2019ve purchased a phone with lot of RAM, to keep it empty? Even if you\u2019re doing perfectly fine with task killers you\u2019re wasting a lot of CPU cycles which could be used somewhere else.\n\n\nI am an android developer, disabling receivers causes a lot of development issues to me. I find this guide humiliating.\n\n\nAns. This guide is written by user not developer so please post no offence to developer. This guide helps in how to use an app not how to disable a particular app.\n\n\nAre there any other tips apart from this app which can help me in having better performance?\n\n\nAns. Yes, don\u2019t use any widgets at all. If you ask me I\u2019m using only one widget which is Clock included in stock ROM. Having a widget is like having an app running in background. Total number of apps installed on my device is more than 300. Still I am very confident that I\u2019m having best performance my device has to offer. This app can be used to disable the widget intent which results in permanent disabling of widgets for specific app. The possible intent/action names can be APPWIDGET_PROVIDER or APPWIDGET_UPDATE.\n\n\nI\u2019m new and I don\u2019t understand functions of all intents.\n\n\nAns. You\u2019re talking about Android OS intents and Google Apps intents. Just Google that intent name and you\u2019ll find your answer.\n\n\nIf I update an app will it hurt the configuration I made for that specific app?\n\n\nAns. Probably yes. It depends, maybe the new release has some new receivers or maybe some receivers have been removed.\n\n\nI find this whole scenario a very tedious task.\n\n\nAns. Yes it is. I\u2019m not denying that fact. I took me several hours when I recently purchased a new device. However this app is very useful because of search and filters features.\n\n\nI purchased high speed SD card but nothing improved. Why?\n\n\nAns. Please read SD card specifications and your device specifications. Your phone might not be having high speed SD slot and your high speed SD card is running in backward compatibility mode.\n\n\nHow does Basic mode work?\n\n\nAutorun Manager in basic mode lists all installed apps which are intended to start at boot, if you click on any of the apps you can disable it, that will kill it when it starts at boot time. Please note that on Froyo and newer android versions apps may restart themself, these apps will be marked as !!self restarter!! in the application list.\n\n\nI have disabled an app but it is still started after boot/is restarted, why?\n\n\nSome services are written to automatically restart themself if they are killed, these are detected by Autorun Manager and marked in application list on the bottom right as !!self restarter!! (this label appears only for disabled apps after reboot) you really have better leave these enabled.\n\n\nHow does Advanced mode work?\n\n\nAdvanced mode list all the applications which are registered for system intents and shows you what receivers listen to what intents. It also gives you the control over these, so you can enable and disable these. With the help of Advanced mode you gain real and full control.\n\n\nApplication says root access needed. What is it and how can i get it?\n\n\nRoot access means you have superuser (su) permissions on your phone (only su can modify some parts of the system). To achieve it you have to make some modifications on your phones software which may hurt your guarantee, on the other side it will make it available to install custom ROMs, do full system backups, tether your internet, install applications to sd, run AutoKiller (and many other su related apps), and much more (check \nthis\n, \nthis\n and \nthis\n). The internet is full with descriptions how to root your phone, you shall just google for it, or start \nhere\n. You can also check \nthis\n wiki for more info.",
