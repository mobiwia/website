Information about the settings we tweak \u00b6 Most of the following information are copied from various forums from XDA or MoDaCo, credit goes to original writers. Here the long story: I just was curious if already someone tried to play around with Android's internal low-memory task killer. We all know that Android uses a different way of handling processes. Instead of killing every process after its Activity ended, processes are kept until the system needs more memory. These processes usually should not harm the overall performance and should give speed improvements if you start an Activity again. That's the idea. But when does Android kill a process? And which process? As far as I understood android keeps a LRU (last recently used) list and starts killing the oldest unneeded process. This way it is much smarter than any of the taskkillers we see in the Market. Just for curiosity I started to investigate how this mechanism works. Please correct me if you think that I got something wrong: What I found out: ActivityManagerService.java tracks the \"importance\" of processes (is foreground, is running a service, ..) and reflects this importance by setting the \"oom_adj\" value of the process. (For info: \"oom_adj\" is a value of every process under Linux which gives the kernel a hint, which process it can kill in an oom [out of memory] situation. You can see this value on every Linux 2.6 system in the proc directory: /proc/[PID]/oom_adj ). The higher this value is set, the more likely this process gets selected by the kernel's oom killer.) It seems that on Android the current forefround application gets an oom_adj value of 0 and as soon it's not visible anymore it gets some higher value. I assume the concrete value is dependent by the processes' place in the LRU list. The out-of-memory killer in the standard Linux kernel only runs in one situation: when the available memory is critical low. However in the Android Linux kernel there is implemented a more fine-grained handling of low memory situations. I found the kernel source file \" lowmemorykiller.c \" (located in the kernel source tree under \"drivers/misc/\"; or look here for GIT source tree: tinyurl.com/lowmemkiller). This module seems to be more configurable than the kernel's standard out-of-memory killer as you can define more than one memory limit, when it should get active and you can tell it which oom_adj values it may kill. In other words: You can say \" if free memory goes below XXXX then kill some process with oom_adj greater then YYY; if free memory goes even more below than ZZZ then start to kill some processes with oom_adj greater than XYXY. and so on.. \" So it's possible to define multiple memory criterias and matching processes which can be killed in these situations. Android seems to group running processes into 6 different categories (comments taken out of \"ActivityManagerServer.java\"): FOREGROUND_APP: // This is the process running the current foreground app. We'd really // rather not kill it! Value set in system/rootdir/init.rc on startup. VISIBLE_APP: // This is a process only hosting activities that are visible to the // user, so we'd prefer they don't disappear. Value set in // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup. SECONDARY_SERVER: // This is a process holding a secondary server -- killing it will not // have much of an impact as far as the user is concerned. Value set in // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup. HIDDEN_APP: // This is a process only hosting activities that are not visible, // so it can be killed without any disruption. Value set in // system/rootdir/init.rc on startup. CONTENT_PROVIDER: // This is a process with a content provider that does not have any clients // attached to it. If it did have any clients, its adjustment would be the // one for the highest-priority of those processes. EMPTY_APP: // This is a process without anything currently running in it. Definitely // the first to go! Value set in system/rootdir/init.rc on startup. // This value is initalized in the constructor, careful when refering to // this static variable externally. These 6 categories are reflected by 6 memory limits which are configured for the lowmemorykiller in the kernel. Fortunately, it is possible to configure the lowmemorykiller at runtime! :) (But only if you are root). The configuration is set in the file: \"/sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree\" So if you want to see the current settings, you can do: # cat /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree This should produce output like this (or similiar): 1536,2048,4096,5120,5632,6144 These values are the 6 memory limits on which Anedroid starts to kill processes of one of the 6 categories above. Be careful, the units of these values are pages !! 1 page = 4 kilobyte. So the example above says that Anddroid starts killing EMPTY_APP processes if available memory goes below 24MB (=6144*4/1024). And it starts to kill unused CONTENT_PROVIDERs if available memory goes below 22MB (=5632*4/1024). So if you want to try if your Hero goes faster when fewer processes are running you can try to adjust these settings. For example if you practically do not want any empty processes you can set the corresponding value very high. For example, you can set the values like this: # echo \"1536,2048,4096,5120,15360,23040\" > /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree This example will tell Android to kill unused Content providers if less then 60MB is available and kill empty processes if available memory goes below 90MB. All other processes will stay untouched! Do you see the advantage compared to process killers? One word about durabilty: If you change the settings like this, they are NOT PERMANENT . They will be gone after the next restart of your phone. So you can try to play around a little bit. source: XDA","title":"Theory"},{"location":"autokiller/details/#theory-technical-details","text":"","title":"Theory / Technical details"},{"location":"autokiller/details/#information-about-the-settings-we-tweak","text":"Most of the following information are copied from various forums from XDA or MoDaCo, credit goes to original writers.

It also features a built in task manager and process killer. How does it work? \u00b6 Please check theory/technical details part of this site, this is also a good reading. Why is it good to me? \u00b6 Tasks are handled by the os, apps you no longer use will be cleared up in the background, no user interaction needed. How shall I use it? \u00b6 Check out the great article on Geek For Me . I heard android handles free memory well, why should I keep free memory? \u00b6 Actually android does a great job with memory handling, and free ram is filled with cache immediately. So you have nothing such as \"free\" ram. Application says root access needed. What is it and how can i get it? \u00b6 Root access means you have superuser (su) permissions on your phone (only su can modify some parts of the system). To achieve it you have to make some modifications on your phones software which may hurt your guarantee, on the other side it will make it available to install custom ROMs, do full system backups, tether your internet, install applications to sd, run AutoKiller (and many other su related apps), and much more (check this , this and this ). The internet is full with descriptions how to root your phone, you shall just google for it, or start here . You can also check this wiki for more info. I set a minfree preset but my free memory doesn't alway get above the settings/I still have empty apps, etc... \u00b6 Unused ram is wasting of resources, so android (and the linux kernel it is built on) handles stuff wisely. AutoKiller is not killing applications meaninglessly to reach the tresholds but leaves the cleanup to the system which does it properly. My best advice is to stop checking free ram, just enjoy the smooth and lag free behavior even when your device was not rebooted for weeks. I heard that killing applications is unnecessary on an android device, so why should I use AutoKiller? \u00b6 Unfortunately there are many applications which cannot sleep properly, or don't release resources. (the most annoying I met with was a task killer!!!) if you have the time to find out which are these one bye one, you can kill them any time you finish using them. But if you don't want to mess with this, setting lowmemory killer is the best approach as a fix. \"free\" memory is not useless: memory is always filled up with cache of your most used applications. So you get resource-consuming applications killed, and got cache with preloaded data your phone will probably use. Which is the best setting? \u00b6 It depends on how you use your phone, you shall discover the best for your device, start with presets and fine-tune manually. I clicked on Keep alive/Lower oom, but this setting is not kept. Is the app working wrong? \u00b6 Actually what this function does is that it sets the process' oom value to the lowest possible value (-17) so it will be the last in the list of killable processes. This doesn't mean it won't be killed, but the possibility is lowered. An other fact is that oom is set by the system, usually when an activity comes to front, and sometimes also in other cases, so there is no possibility to keep this setting over sessions. Conventional keep alive function therefore will never be implemented. I set up AutoKiller and it killed my Clock/Twitter/etc... \u00b6 If you set really high values, it can happen that empty apps like stock android clock in background get killed. My advise in this situation is to lower the limits/choose a lower preset (-you can create direct shortcuts on your desktop to set a preset). You can also make sure that clock is running during the night if that is the last app opened before the phone is sent into sleep mode. I have donated and would like to set up alternate preset option properly... \u00b6 My suggestion is to set AutoKiller to one preset lower than you would withouth this feature, so it can play nice while you use it, and set the alternate preset option to something higher, to make it clean apps in bg in case it is needed while your phone's screen is turned off. In case of my N1 I set AutoKiller to 'Aggressive' and alternate preset to 'Ultimate'. For devices with less available ram you shall choose lower values accordingly. What is Chuck Norris mode? When shall I use it? \u00b6 Chuck Norris mode uses system's built in kill command to terminate the selected application. This is an aggressive way to close running applications, and lets you kill **any** running app. Including dialer and system which can lead to a quick system restart. Use this only if you know what you are doing.","title":"F.A.Q."},{"location":"autokiller/faq/#faq","text":"","title":"F.A.Q."},{"location":"autokiller/faq/#is-autokiller-a-task-killer","text":"The main functionality is a minfree manager (see theory section) which tweaks system's built in routines.

This app isn\u2019t free, however trial version is available at play store so you can try before you spend your hard earned money. I must mention that this app is very affordable comparing to the other apps or games for which you might have paid in past. I would hire a task killer rather than purchasing this app, reading huge guide and hard thinking what intent is doing what. \u00b6 Ans. As I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t recommend task killers at all. It results in unexpected results from app and even developers refuse to support if you\u2019re using task killers. Let me ask you, why you\u2019ve purchased a phone with lot of RAM, to keep it empty? Even if you\u2019re doing perfectly fine with task killers you\u2019re wasting a lot of CPU cycles which could be used somewhere else. I am an android developer, disabling receivers causes a lot of development issues to me. I find this guide humiliating. \u00b6 Ans. This guide is written by user not developer so please post no offence to developer. This guide helps in how to use an app not how to disable a particular app. Are there any other tips apart from this app which can help me in having better performance? \u00b6 Ans. Yes, don\u2019t use any widgets at all. If you ask me I\u2019m using only one widget which is Clock included in stock ROM. Having a widget is like having an app running in background. Total number of apps installed on my device is more than 300. Still I am very confident that I\u2019m having best performance my device has to offer. This app can be used to disable the widget intent which results in permanent disabling of widgets for specific app. The possible intent/action names can be APPWIDGET_PROVIDER or APPWIDGET_UPDATE. I\u2019m new and I don\u2019t understand functions of all intents. \u00b6 Ans. You\u2019re talking about Android OS intents and Google Apps intents. Just Google that intent name and you\u2019ll find your answer. If I update an app will it hurt the configuration I made for that specific app? \u00b6 Ans. Probably yes. It depends, maybe the new release has some new receivers or maybe some receivers have been removed. I find this whole scenario a very tedious task. \u00b6 Ans. Yes it is. I\u2019m not denying that fact. I took me several hours when I recently purchased a new device. However this app is very useful because of search and filters features. I purchased high speed SD card but nothing improved. Why? \u00b6 Ans. Please read SD card specifications and your device specifications. Your phone might not be having high speed SD slot and your high speed SD card is running in backward compatibility mode. How does Basic mode work? \u00b6 Autorun Manager in basic mode lists all installed apps which are intended to start at boot, if you click on any of the apps you can disable it, that will kill it when it starts at boot time. Please note that on Froyo and newer android versions apps may restart themself, these apps will be marked as !!self restarter!! in the application list. I have disabled an app but it is still started after boot/is restarted, why? \u00b6 Some services are written to automatically restart themself if they are killed, these are detected by Autorun Manager and marked in application list on the bottom right as !!self restarter!! (this label appears only for disabled apps after reboot) you really have better leave these enabled. How does Advanced mode work? \u00b6 Advanced mode list all the applications which are registered for system intents and shows you what receivers listen to what intents. It also gives you the control over these, so you can enable and disable these. With the help of Advanced mode you gain real and full control. Application says root access needed. What is it and how can i get it? \u00b6 Root access means you have superuser (su) permissions on your phone (only su can modify some parts of the system). To achieve it you have to make some modifications on your phones software which may hurt your guarantee, on the other side it will make it available to install custom ROMs, do full system backups, tether your internet, install applications to sd, run AutoKiller (and many other su related apps), and much more (check this , this and this ).

He approved me to publish it here: Autorun Manager \u00b6 This is an app for android OS developed by Mobiwia AndRS studio. As the name indicates this app is used to prevent apps from spawning automatically that keeps on running at background eating up resources resulting in overall reduced performance of android device. This app doesn\u2019t boost the speed of your device but actually assures that the user gets what device is really capable of. As many of us are familiar to Microsoft Windows operating system, whenever we install a new application in windows we tend to use windows start-up manager or any other third party app to disable unnecessary start-ups which increases booting speed of windows. Similarly we can improve the performance of our android device. The Android OS works in a very different way than windows, so before we directly start disabling start-ups on android we need to know how Android OS works so that we can take the full benefit of Autorun Manager app else we will just end up in frustration and writing horrible review for developer. I am writing Android OS guide from the perspective of using Autorun Manager app so that you can understand each and every function of this app. So what exactly we need to improve? \u00b6 There are three main things which we need to consider in order to speed-up the overall performance, CPU usage, Memory usage and R/W speeds. For R/W speeds I recommend you to buy good performance SD cards because tweaking this in android would be digging too deep. Memory usage is smartly managed by Android OS itself and you can tweak that with AutoKiller Memory Optimizer. I do not recommend killing any task intentionally at all. This results in misbehaviour of OS or app adding a plus to frustration. Remaining this is CPU usage which we really need to consider. I would be discussing all about to improve overall CPU performance. Why this app is running? \u00b6 In Android, apps get started automatically by using the broadcast receivers. A broadcast receiver has number of intents/actions. Whenever these actions are performed by OS/app the receiver gets triggered. The receiver then starts the app in the background and performs necessary actions in the background as decided by developer. Typical example can be, let\u2019s say intent/action is boot completed under receiver boot. Whenever android OS finishes the boot process it broadcast the message that it has finished booting. The receivers who are able to listen to this action gets triggered and starts the app. So disabling this receiver would simply disable the app from listening to this broadcast message. Remember, whether this receiver can be disabled safely is judged on basis of action/intents present in it instead of reading receiver names. Packages \u00b6 There are basically two types of packages which can be classified further. The apps which are located at /system/app/ are known as system apps also known as pre-installed apps. Apps which are located at /data partition are known as user apps also known as downloaded apps. System apps are installed in internal memory which is fastest and some of this memory is shared with /data partition so that users can install their favourite apps. Newer phones come with huge internal storage, fact behind this is embedded SD card also known as internal SD card. SD cards have slower I/O speeds than internal system storage. Additional plugged in SD card would be called as external SD card. Apps located on SD card are less affected by broadcast receivers. However apps are still affected broadcast receivers which are on internal SD card, which is because internal SD card mounted before booting. Apps located on external SD cards are less affected by broadcast receivers because they are mounted after Android OS finishes booting. So a useful tip would be installing apps on external SD card. Such apps can be games, utility apps but not useful apps like mail or chat clients. However I still recommend you to disable unwanted receivers for these apps as well. Disabling broadcast receivers for system apps is recommended at all and can cause significant unexpected issues. But if you\u2019re an advanced user I encourage you to play with these apps as well. Such system apps can be preloaded promotional apps, games or any other less useful app. First Launch of app \u00b6 This app can be run in two modes Advanced mode and Basic mode. Basic mode is not recommended and is for total beginners and for those who doesn\u2019t want to read this guide. Reason is, in basic mode the automatically starting app is killed as soon as it gets started. This scenario will make circumstances even worse who are running low performance devices. What technically happens, an apps starts automatically and Autoruns Manager app kills it. Lots of CPU cycles are wasted in this process. Some developers include functionality of re-spawning i.e. the app is started automatically after few seconds when it gets killed and pre-mentioned procedure keeps on going. Recommended is using advanced mode. Above image explains each and everything detailed. Now you got idea of what thing is what, let\u2019s get into what\u2019s happening. As you can see there\u2019s a package named Autorun Manager which is the app itself I\u2019m using for explaining things. This release of package has three broadcast receivers. Each of these receivers has single intent/action present in it. Before we start disabling receivers, first try to understand the reason why this receiver is included with these actions and what functionality would be removed if I disable that receiver. First receiver is named as \u201ccom.rs.autorun.AutorunStartupIntentReceiver\u201d. Remember receiver names are customized by developers so no decision can be made by just reading receiver name. It just helps in getting idea what kind of actions could be present in that receiver. This receiver has one action named \u201candroid.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\u201d. The lower case letters are representing package name which is Android OS itself in this case while the upper case letters are representing action name. It is now clear in this case that when Android OS is finishing boot process it is broadcasting message that it has finished booting. The broadcast receiver listens this broadcasting and starts the app. Now before we disable try to guess which functionality might be disabled if I disable this broadcast receiver. Possible reasons can be, the basic mode won\u2019t work because it requires the app itself to be in running condition to kill apps. Second receiver has intent named \u201ccom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\u201d. In this case package name is Google Play Store. When you install any package from Google Play Store it broadcasts the message and this receiver listens to it. Possible reasons could be collecting statistical data. Third receiver has intent named \u201ccom.rs.autorun.PeriodicAlarm\u201d. In this case package name is Autorun Manager the app itself I\u2019m using. The app itself broadcasts message and receivers listens to it and perform necessary actions. Figuring out such receivers is very hard because we\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s on developer\u2019s mind. Usually these receivers are vital parts of app. There is no need to disable such receivers because if the broadcasting app is not running then there is no triggering at all. --thank you VivEk","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"autorun/userguide/#user-guide","text":"A dear user of Autorun Manager VivEk wrote a user guide based on a user's perspective.

The FAQ contains a lot of useful information about possible problems, use cases etc. What does it do? \u00b6 GPS Status & Toolbox is a simple program to show all the GPS and sensor data of your phone. It is designed to be simple, yet effective. It helps you to see what is happening while the GPS is trying to acquire your locations and can be used as a simple compass, as a leveling tool. It will measure the phone\u2019s speed and acceleration, the brightness or the air pressure (if your phone has the necessary sensors.) The program also supports basic navigation functions that are useful when you are out in the wild. The app has four main screens plus it can display a system notification to show GPS data. Status - display for all your raw data Radar - for basic off-road navigation Locations - for your stored locations Sensors - for listing and testing all the sensors available in your device Settings - for customizing units, display properties Status screen \u00b6 The screen has three main parts: The sky grid (G) , the signal strength bar (V) and the instrument panels . The sky grid (G) shows the GPS satellites above you as the receiver in the phone detects them. GPS satellites (with IDs 1-32) are represented by disks. GLONASS satellites (with IDs r1-r25) are shown as rectangles, BEIDOU satellites (with IDs c1-c33) are shown as crosses (x) while GALILEO sats (with IDs e1-e35) are displayed as plus (+) signs. The size of the symbol depends on the signal strength received from that satellite. The color shows what data is available for that satellite and how it is currently used by the phone. green : satellite is used while determining the location yellow : all orbital data is available, but the satellite is not used blue : only rough orbital data (almanach) is available grey : orbital data is not available Usually at least 4 satellites are required to have a lock. The more satellites are available the more accurate the position will be (to a certain limit. i.e. having 20 sats in a lock does not really increase the accuracy compared to 10). Certain phones may opt to use only a single constellation at a time and fall back to others if that constellation does not have enough visible satellites.) The order of preference is market dependent, however it is mostly GPS, then GLONASS and then BEIODU. As of the beginning of 2017 only a few phones support the GALILEO constellation. If you have problems getting a fix, please read the FAQ for troubleshoothing tips. The compass needle (C) in the center of the grid will show you the direction of the magnetic field as measured by your phone. (This may or may not be the actual magnetic north, depending on how much extra magnetic field is present in your environment. Magnetic anomalies are always present in buildings and vehicles so you should NOT expect your compass to work flawlessly in these environments.) The program automatically calculates the magnetic declination (the difference between magnetic and true north) and the absolute strength of the magnetic field at your current location (M) . If the measured field is stronger than the calculated you will see the needle grow while with weaker fields the needle will shrink. If there are no extra magnetic fields in your environment the needle should be roughly the same size as the inner circle of the sky grid. In addition to this, the magnetic compass in your phone reports the accuracy of the measurement. If the needle gets transparent (or you see a question mark appearing in the magnetic field reading instrument) then the compass may need a recalibration (in the side navigation Compass Calibration menu). The recalibration can be done any time the app is running (i.e. you don't need to enter the 'Calibration' dialog, however that dialog displays the accuracy reported by the phone so you will get a bit better feedback.) You can recalibrate by either rotation your phone several times along its 3 axes (as instructed in the dialog), or by less scientifically, just simply holding your phone and waving it in an 8 pattern. You should test which method works best as it is also dependent on the actual firmware of the phone. Magnetic compasses are inherently inaccurate. GPS can do a much better job determining your direction of movement. By default the sky grid aligns itself using the magnetic compass. Once you move faster than 5km/h a green arrow will appear showing your direction of movement and the sky grid will align using the much more accurate GPS heading data. The red/blue arrows (W) around the perimeter of the grid show the true north/south while the red/blue dots (X) show the magnetic north/south. The difference between the two direction is known as the magnetic declination (M) . Tip There is a small empty circle (Y) (can be turned off in Settings) that allows you to find the direction of any satellite. Just turn and tilt your phone until the circle covers a satellite symbol. Your phone will point towards the real satellite that is some 20000 km away from you. (This feature is not particularly useful, but it is extremely geeky!) The grid also contains a moving amber circle (can be turned off in Settings). This can be used as a leveling tool (L) to find horizontal or vertical surfaces using your phone. You may need to calibrate the leveling tool before using it (in the side navigation menu). In the PRO version, the rotation speed (R) of the phone is also displayed along the perimeter of the sky grid. The longer the green arcs, the faster the phone is rotating. The signal strength bars (V) show the individual satellite signal strength values. The bar is divided into 4 parts displaying GPS, GLONASS, BEIDOU and GALILEO sats (left to right). The rest of the screen displays numerical values derived from the phone\u2019s sensors and GPS. Heading (H) : the absolute direction the phone is facing Orientation (O) : main cardinal points your phone is heading currently aGPS data age (E) : the age of the GPS assistance data used for speeding up the GPS locks. Error (E) : the accuracy of the actual location information. Number of satellites (F) : the number of satellites used for the actual fix and the total number of satellites visible for the GPS receiver (GPS+GLONASS/total.) Pitch and Roll (L) : the attitude of your phone. Magnetic field (M) : the three values represent the strength of measured magnetic field / the calculated strength of the field / magnetic declination (the difference between true and magnetic north). (Tip: the first slash will turn into a question mark if the phone detects that you have to recalibrate the phone\u2019s magnetometer.) Acceleration (Z) : the measured linear acceleration of the phone. Speed (S) : the actual speed measured by the GPS. Altitude (A) : the current altitude relative to the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or the WGS84 geoid (configured in Settings). Last fix (I) : the GPS time of the last valide fix that is shown currently on the screen. Location (latitude/longitude) (J) : The acquired GPS location (format is configured in Settings). Battery info (B) : the remaining charge, battery voltage and temperature. DOP (dilution of precision) (D) : a value that represents how optimal the satellite constellation is. Smaller values represent better satellite arrangement. The total, horizontal and vertical component is also displayed. Brightness (K) : the measured light flux (if the phone supports it). The accuracy of this value is dependent on the quality of the brightness sensor. Pressure (P) [ PRO ]: atmospheric pressure measured by the phone sensor (if the phone supports it). Rotation speed (R) [ PRO ]: this is the direct readout from the phone\u2019s gyroscope sensor (if the phone supports it). Ambient temperature (T) [ PRO ]: the temperature around the phone (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3). Dewpoint (N) [ PRO ]: the temperature below which water vapor will start condense (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3). Humidity (Q) [ PRO ]: the amount of water vapor in the air (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3). Humidex (U) [ PRO ]: an index that shows how hot the weather feels to the average person (available only on Galaxy S4 and Note3). Status Notification \u00b6 By default, the application will show the most important GPS data whenever the GPS is accesses, even if other apps accessing it. If you do not need the notification feature, you can turn it off in Settings / Background Behavior / GPS Status in Notification -> Never . (A) Number of satellites: GPS in use [+ GLONASS in use] / Total visible (B) Average signal to noise ratio (0-40dB) (D) Dilution of Precision (smaller is better) (S) Speed (L) Current location (A) Altitude (E) Position accuracy Tapping on the notification item will open GPS Status. This is an easy way to open the app from any other application that is using the GPS. Wait for the lock in GPS Status then press the back button to immediately return to the original application without loosing the lock. The notification have some extra actions that allows you to dismiss it temporarily, re-download the aGPS data, or mark your current position for future use. Note This feature uses little to no battery as the notification is updated only when it is shown. The display routine does NOT access or keep the GPS open. It just intercepts the location data that is requested by the other application. GPS Status never keeps the GPS open if it was put into the background. Radar screen \u00b6 Radar screen can store a single way point (Edit/Mark action button) and allows you to navigate back using the GPS and the internal compass in your phone. Just move towards the point and use the screen as it would be a \"radar\". The radar screen will display heading and distance to the target point. It is possible to enter or edit the target coordinates and you can also share your current location by using the Share action. The marked point can be displayed in any of the supported mapping applications. Additional waypoints can be displayed on the radar if you change the given waypoint's visibility on the Locations screen (tap the eye icon). Tip Long tapping the Edit/Mark mark location button will immediately store the current location as a target (and will override the previous target without displaying a dialog). This is useful to drop a breadcrumb so you will be able to get back here later (i.e. after parking a car etc.) Heading (H) : the absolute direction the phone is facing. Orientation (O) : main cardinal points your phone is heading currently. Compass needle (C) : magnetic compass needle. Error (E) : the accuracy of the actual location information. Distance (D) : distance to the current target point. Accuracy range (F) : the current position accuracy shown as a range around the actual position. Target (latitude/longitude) (L) : the coordinates of the currently selected target point. Speed (S) : the actual speed. Altitude (A) : the current altitude relative to the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or the WGS84 geoid (configured in Settings). Bearing (B) : Bearing to the target point Location (latitude/longitude) (J) : the current location. Target point (T) : the target point shown on the radar grid relative to the current position. Additional waypoints (W) [ PRO ]: additional waypoints selected on the Locations screen. Locations \u00b6 This screen allows you to store 3 waypoints persistently (unlimited in PRO version). Long tapping an item puts the list into edit mode where you can select more items or reorder them. After selecting items you can export them by choosing the \"Export\" item the action bar. Importing in KML, CSV and GPX format is also available here. Waypoints can be added either from the Radar screen by opening the Edit target dialog and choosing \"Save as POI\" or by tapping the 'Add location' button on the 'Locations' screen. You can assign a color to the point. You can edit an item by tapping on it. The Edit dialog allows you to select the given point as a target on the Radar screen. Sensor Diagnostics \u00b6 This screen can be used for troubleshooting phone sensor issues. It displays all possible sensors and marks the ones that are actually supported by your device. It also tries to acquire some values from the sensors to see whether they are working correctly. If you see error marks on the list, tap the entry and follow the instruction to test the given sensors properly. Settings \u00b6 Display units, UI language, sensor filtering, color scheme, message used for sharing your location and a bunch of other options can be configured to customize the application. Note that GPS Status is using the WGS84 datum whenever coordinates are used.

PRIVACY POLICY"},{"location":"gpsstatus/faq/","text":"FAQ \u00b6 I have no idea how this app is working... \u00b6 Please read the User Guide to learn how to use it. Steps to follow if you have a non-locking GPS \u00b6 Side menu / Manage aGPS state. Select 'Reset' to clear the internal state of the GPS. Select 'Download' to re-download the assistance data. You will need an active internet connection at this step. Close the GPS Status application for 10 seconds. Go outside and find a spot where large part of the sky is visible. Make sure you have the 'Keep the screen on' settings turned on (in Settings / Display & Tools'. Let the program run and try to acquire your GPS position for at least 15 minutes. Note If the above steps do not resolve the GPS issue then you most likely have a hardware problem with the phone. Certain phone cases block the GPS signal (remove the phone from it, if you are not sure.) Certain windshields may block the GPS signal inside cars (those that have metallic coating to keep the heat out.) Certain phones (usually CDMA) turn off the GPS chip if you put the phone into flight mode. If you travel a long distance without turning on the GPS (i.e. flight) you can expect much longer fix times at your destination initially. You cannot expect the GPS to work in your basement! (yes I'm serious) I have previously purchased the PRO version, but now I have to reinstall it. How do I re-activate my license? \u00b6 Purchases on Google Play are bound to your google account. It means that you can activate the license on ALL of your devices as long as they are registered with your google account. You should never ever pay twice for the same thing! Prior to 2016 GPS Status used separate 'key' application for licensing. Starting from the beginning of 2016 in-app payments are used for licensing. First you need to know which type of license you have. The best is to take a look at your purchase history and find GPS Status on wallet.google.com . If you have purchased the PRO key application, you can re-download it again from the Play Store . If you purchased the license as an in-app payment (you will see \"PRO Features\" in your transaction list), just install and open the main (free) app and tap the 'Get PRO' item in the side navigation menu. Play Store will detect and inform you that you already own this item and GPS Status will activate the license immediately. If you have issues or you have changed your google account for whatever reason, please contact the support address with your original transaction id. I do not like/need the notification when an app accesses the GPS. Can I turn it off? \u00b6 Yes. GPS Status never runs in the background unless an other app access the GPS. You can turn off the notification feature in 'Settings / Background behavior / Show Notification = Never' and then restarting the app (quitting with the back button and then starting it again). The notification sometimes is not sown when Goolge Maps is running. \u00b6 This is happening on Android 6 and later. Goolge Maps is no longer using the GPS in the phone directly. Instead it's using Google's proprietary \"fused location provider\". Because of this, GPS is started only occasionally in the background and 3 rd party applications are not notified about it. Sadly this cannot be worked around as indeed in these cases GPS is NOT used so there is no point to show the status. Why do you need permission XXX? \u00b6 coarse and fine location: we need this to display your location :) full internet access: used by the advertisement and analytics component. access extra location provider commands: allows the program to re-download AGPS data or reset the GPS. view network state: allows checking if there is an active internet connection. If there is no net connection, advertisement and AGPS download is disabled to save memory and battery. Storage and Media Access:This is need only to be able to Export/Import your stored waypoints to the exteral storage. It is eating all my battery according to the battery status screen. It is even running in the background. \u00b6 Fortunately no. The bug is in the battery measurement routines in Android. The operating system sometimes misses the notification when the application releases the phone sensors (i.e. this issue affects all apps that heavily use the sensor system). Because of the missed \"release message\" the battery measurement routines continue to count the battery use against the application even if that application was stopped long ago and not even present in the process list. You can simply ignore this. Unfortunately you need to restart the phone to \"fix\" this malcalculation. Once you've rebooted the phone you will see the correct values again and the \"phantom\" usage will disappear. The reason why this is increasing over time without even running is that the power usage is calculated for the sensor by (current time - sensor attach time)*sensorPowerRequirements. As time passes, this value increases. The GPS time is 15 seconds ahead of the official UTC time. Why? I thought GPS clocks must be extremely accurate. \u00b6 The rotation period of the Earth is not constant and in average it is 2ms longer than 86400 sec. This causes some drift over time between the atomic clocks (used by the GPS system) and the UTC time. To avoid confusion, every now and then leap seconds are inserted into the UTC time. (Yes, there are sometimes 61s long minutes!). GPS and UTC was in sync in 1980. Since then 15 leap seconds were inserted into the UTC time. The GPS satellites brodcast this information, but only in every 12minutes. Your receiver may not heard the broadcast, so it does not know how much it should substract from the GPS time. Without this information it just displays the GPS time and does not correct it to get UTC. You should wait at least 15 minutes with the GPS turned on to receive the correction data. Some parts of the application are not translated or there are translation errors. \u00b6 Feel free to join the GPS Status translation project at crowdin.net . You can add new translations, or correct existing ones. The location/altitude or other data is inaccurate. \u00b6 GPS Status simply displays the data received directly from the phone hardware. In fact this is the main pupose of the software (that's why it's called status). Inaccurate data is not the fault of the software, but shows that you may not have optimal reception of GPS satellites or there is a magnetic anomaly nearby affecting your compass. Find a different location and try again. If you feel that the data is inaccurate, it may indicate a hardware issue. Please note that the sensors in your phone (including the GPS receiver) are very prone to environmental disturbances. My compass is very \"jumpy\"... \u00b6 Try to set the sensor filtering in preferences. It can filter out the measurement noise, but at the same time the compass will react slower to changes. Is it showing magnetic or true north? How to set the magnetic declination? \u00b6 Magnetic declination is the difference between the true and magnetic north at your location. The value is calculated automatically by the program using the current geo-magnetic earth model. The algorithm uses your current location and time. To answer the question: The needle in the middle is always showing the magnetic north while the grid itself (small red arrow) points always towards true north. The angle between these two corresponds to the magnetic declination. The last number in the \"Magnetic field\" instrument is the magnetic declination in degrees. My compass points to the wrong direction or I'm asked to calibrate my compass. What should I do? \u00b6 Your phone contains a digital compass which measures the magnetic field's strength in three direction with three separate sensors. The orientation of your phone is calculated from these values. Unfortunately the sensitivity of the sensors can be a little different. To correctly calculate your orientation your phone must measure first these differences. This is done during the calibration process. To calibrate your phone, simply find a space where no external magnetic field is present (preferable outside of buildings) and rotate your phone 1-2 times on EACH of its three axes. (Swinging your phone in big 8s in all direction will also do, but it's less scientifically correct :) ). If you feel that your compass has become inaccurate you can repeat this procedure. NOTE: You should expect the compass to be very unreliable inside buildings or vehicles often pointing in opposite directions. What does the Magnetic field reading mean? \u00b6 Aside from your orientation, your phone can measure the absolute strength of the magnetic field which is displayed as the first number in the reading. The second number is calculated from your GPS position and current time using the earth geo-magnetic model. It is the theoretical strengh you should measure in an open space. If the two values are sufficiently different, then you are standing in a magnetic anomaly. This is pretty funny because this allows you to detect big nearby metal objects. Go and try hunting for treasures. The compass needle changes its size... What the hell? \u00b6 The size of the needle indicates the relative magnitude of measured magnetic field to the calculated value. If the measured and calculated value is the same, the needle should be the same size as the inner circle on the grid. If the magnetic field is bigger/smaller than it should be, the needle will be also bigger/smaller. This way you can see at a glance whether you are standing in a magnetic anomaly. If the needle is too small or too big chances are that an external magnetic field is present and the compass points to the wrong direction.","title":"F.A.Q."},{"location":"gpsstatus/faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"gpsstatus/faq/#i-have-no-idea-how-this-app-is-working","text":"Please read the User Guide to learn how to use it.","title":"I have no idea\u00a0how this app is working..."},{"location":"gpsstatus/faq/#steps-to-follow-if-you-have-a-non-locking-gps","text":"Side menu / Manage aGPS state.
